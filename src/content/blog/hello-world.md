This is the first post on my new personal website. I built it with [Astro](https://astro.build) and it's hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Why a personal site?

A place to write, share projects, and have a corner of the internet that's mine.

## What's next

- More writing about software and things I'm learning
- Project showcases
- Maybe some notes on books and ideas

Stay tuned.
